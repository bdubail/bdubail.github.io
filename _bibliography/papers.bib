    abstract = "{In operator algebra, the linearization trick is a technique that reduces the study of a non-commutative polynomial evaluated at elements of an algebra $A$ to the study of a polynomial of degree one, evaluated on the enlarged algebra $A \otimes M_r(C)$, for some integer $r$. We introduce a new instance of the linearization trick that is tailored to study a finitely supported random walk $G$ by studying instead a nearest-neighbour coloured random walk on $G x \{1, ... , r \}$, which is much simpler to analyze. As an application, we extend well-known results for nearest-neighbour walks on free groups and free products of finite groups to coloured random walks, thus showing how one can obtain new results for finitely supported random walks, namely an explicit description of the harmonic measure and formulas for the entropy and drift.}",

title = "{Accelerating Abelian Random Walks with Hyperbolic Dynamics}",
journal = {Probability Theory and Related Fields,},
abstract = "{Given integers $d \geq 2, n \geq 1$, we consider affine random walks on torii $(Z/nZ)^{d}$ defined as $X_{t+1} = A X_{t} + B_{t} \mod n$, where $A \in GL_{d}(Z)$ is an invertible matrix with integer entries and $(B_{t})_{t \geq 0}$ is a sequence of iid random increments on $Z^{d}$. We show that when $A$ has no eigenvalues of modulus 1, this random walk mixes in $O(log n log log n)$ steps as $n \rightarrow \infty $, and mixes actually in $O(log n)$ steps only for almost all $n$. These results are similar to those of Chung et al. (Ann Probab 15(3):1148–1165, 1987) on the so-called Chung–Diaconis–Graham process, which corresponds to the case $d=1$. Our proof is based on the initial arguments of Chung, Diaconis and Graham, and relies extensively on the properties of the dynamical system $x \rightarrow A^{\top} x$ on the continuous torus $R^{d} / Z^{d}$. Having no eigenvalue of modulus one makes this dynamical system a hyperbolic toral automorphism, a typical example of a chaotic system known to have a rich behaviour. As such our proof sheds new light on the speed-up gained by applying a deterministic map to a Markov chain.}",

      author={Bastien Dubail and Stefan Stojanovic and Alexandre Proutière},

      year={2025},
      abstract = {Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincaré inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.},
