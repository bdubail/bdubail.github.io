    abstract = "{In operator algebra, the linearization trick is a technique that reduces the study of a non-commutative polynomial evaluated at elements of an algebra $A$ to the study of a polynomial of degree one, evaluated on the enlarged algebra $A \otimes M_r(C)$, for some integer $r$. We introduce a new instance of the linearization trick that is tailored to study a finitely supported random walk $G$ by studying instead a nearest-neighbour coloured random walk on $G \times \{1, \ldots , r \}$, which is much simpler to analyze. As an application, we extend well-known results for nearest-neighbour walks on free groups and free products of finite groups to coloured random walks, thus showing how one can obtain new results for finitely supported random walks, namely an explicit description of the harmonic measure and formulas for the entropy and drift.}",

title = "{Accelerating Abelian Random Walks with Hyperbolic Dynamics}",
journal = {Probability Theory and Related Fields},
abstract = "{Given integers $d \geq 2, n \geq 1$, we consider affine random walks on torii $(Z/nZ)^{d}$ defined as $X_{t+1} = A X_{t} + B_{t} \mod n$, where $A \in GL_{d}(Z)$ is an invertible matrix with integer entries and $(B_{t})_{t \geq 0}$ is a sequence of iid random increments on $Z^{d}$. We show that when $A$ has no eigenvalues of modulus 1, this random walk mixes in $O(log n log log n)$ steps as $n \rightarrow \infty $, and mixes actually in $O(log n)$ steps only for almost all $n$. These results are similar to those of Chung et al. (Ann Probab 15(3):1148–1165, 1987) on the so-called Chung–Diaconis–Graham process, which corresponds to the case $d=1$. Our proof is based on the initial arguments of Chung, Diaconis and Graham, and relies extensively on the properties of the dynamical system $x \mapsto A^{\top} x$ on the continuous torus $R^{d} / Z^{d}$. Having no eigenvalue of modulus one makes this dynamical system a hyperbolic toral automorphism, a typical example of a chaotic system known to have a rich behaviour. As such our proof sheds new light on the speed-up gained by applying a deterministic map to a Markov chain.}",
